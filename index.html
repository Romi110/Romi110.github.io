			DAY 3: Picking a college is scary right now but regardless of the choice you make its okay its not the end of the world and youll be alright. It is a big decision but its okay. Hindsight is 20/20 and you still don't know what ur stepping into. Just see what happens and do what you feel is right. When youre on ur deathbed you won't look back!!! casue thats dumb im not tryna give my opinion so you can make ur own decison but any decsion you make is gonna be right :)
